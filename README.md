# Hello World Data Science UCSB Spring 2017
## Repo for Week Two Markdown Practice Template

## Instuctions:
Now that you have gotten familiar with *markdown* I want everyone to create a branch on this repo. It should be called something like `ravi_branch` and upload your file there. 

**DO NOT** change the master branch!

You can erase the original repo if you think it'll just be clutter on your personal *GitHub* account but everyone should create a branch on this repo with what they did on 4/12/2017's meeting. 

See the following image for reference as to how to create one manually:

Any questions ask me on *Slack*!
